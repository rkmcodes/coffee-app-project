# coffee-app-project

This Overall Project README will be updated later to reflect, in detail, how front/back end works together to create a minimum viable product to be able to show to potiential employers. 

I am a Codergirl student at LaunchCode Education. In my current course LiftOff we are working on an team project “from scratch”. My team & I have brainstormed an idea to link a lucrative industry to users to through an MVP designed web application. Through this app my team & I will unite, build & grow a thriving community through a clean, fun and efficient user experience. This app will provide an informational service to the user about the quality of local coffee & coffee products. Users will find usefulness through the app’s sorting & filter features as well incentives for user posting. Another useful feature is the unique addiction of information linking companies to fair trade, eco friendly & sustainable production practices. This idea stemmed from a similar approach involving the beer beverage industry. 

App Idea (Coffee App) - Yelp for coffee beverages; rate coffee, check-in, post pics, reward system, ethical sourcing practices (fair trade, eco-friendly, sustainable production practices), surveys, search through reviews using specific filters, listing all reviews by category, users adding coffee places/flavors/coffee types for their review they post
